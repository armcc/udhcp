# Sample udhcpd configuration file (/etc/udhcpd.conf)
# DHCP Class 
# DHCP Class is a complete set of DHCP server configuration for a logical group
# of clients. Each DHCP class can be configured with different DHCP server
# parameters and form a separate IP address lease block. These DHCP classes
# can be differentiated based on different DHCP Configuration parameters like
# DHCP options, lease interval etc. Currently DHCP classes can be configured 
# based on option 60(vendorid) and option 77(userclass). 

# The location of the leases file is mandatory. Each DHCP class configuration 
# block is indicated by lease_file keyword.
# The lease file name can be in one of the following two formats
# 1. <lease file Directory>/landhcps0.leases. 
# 2. <lease file Directory>/landhcps00.leases. 
# First format means that there are no DHCP classes configured and only default 
# class is available. This is same as having no DHCP class configuration.
# Second format indicates that there are multiple DHCP classes configured on
# the respective interface and the two numbers before ".leases" in the
# file name correspond to the Interface index and class index respectively.
# Rest of the configuration that follows belongs to the particular DHCP class
# and is read accordingly. 


#Examples
# 1.  
# lease_file /var/tmp/landhcps0.leases : Classless configuration.
# Configuration for interface '0' and default class (class '0'). In this 
# configuration following options are not used.
#    a. vendorinfo
#    b. vendorid
#    c. userclass
# 2.  
# lease_file /var/tmp/landhcps00.leases : Classful configuration. 
# Configuration for interface '0' and default class(class '0'). In the default 
# class following options are not used
#    a. vendorinfo
#    b. vendorid
#    c. userclass
# 3.  
# lease_file /var/tmp/landhcps01.leases : Classful configuration. 
# Configuration for interface '0' and class '1' . This is a non-default class 
# and can contain any of the following option combination
#    a. vendorinfo
#    b. vendorid
#   
#       or 
#    a. userclass

lease_file	/var/tmp/landhcps0.leases	#default: /var/lib/misc/udhcpd.leases

# The start and end of the IP lease block for the interface and class specified
# by the lease_file name   

start 		192.168.0.20	#default: 192.168.0.20
end		192.168.0.254	#default: 192.168.0.254


# The interface that udhcpd will use

interface	eth0		#default: eth0


# The maximum number of leases (includes addresses reserved
# by OFFER's, DECLINE's, and ARP conflicts

#max_leases	254		#default: 254


# If remaining is true (default), udhcpd will store the time
# remaining for each lease in the udhcpd leases file. This is
# for embedded systems that cannot keep time between reboots.
# If you set remaining to no, the absolute time that the lease
# expires at will be stored in the dhcpd.leases file.

#remaining	yes		#default: yes


# The time period at which udhcpd will write out a dhcpd.leases
# file. If this is 0, udhcpd will never automatically write a
# lease file. (specified in seconds)

#auto_time	7200		#default: 7200 (2 hours)


# The amount of time that an IP will be reserved (leased) for if a 
# DHCP decline message is received (seconds).

#decline_time	3600		#default: 3600 (1 hour)


# The amount of time that an IP will be reserved (leased) for if an
# ARP conflct occurs. (seconds

#conflict_time	3600		#default: 3600 (1 hour)


# How long an offered address is reserved (leased) in seconds

#offer_time	60		#default: 60 (1 minute)

# If a lease to be given is below this value, the full lease time is
# instead used (seconds).

#min_lease	60		#defult: 60

# The location of the pid file
#pidfile	/var/run/udhcpd.pid	#default: /var/run/udhcpd.pid

# Each time udhcpd writes a leases file, the below script will be called.
# Useful for writing the lease file to flash every few hours.

#notify_file				#default: (no script)

#notify_file	dumpleases 	# useful for debugging

# The following are bootp specific options, usable by udhcpd.

#siaddr		192.168.0.22		#default: 0.0.0.0

#sname		zorak			#default: (none)

#boot_file	/var/nfs_root		#default: (none)

# The remainder options are DHCP options and can be specified with the
# keyword 'opt' or 'option'. If an option can take multiple items, such
# as the dns option, they can be listed on the same line, or multiple
# lines. The only option with a default is 'lease'.

#Examples
opt	dns	192.168.10.2 192.168.10.10
option	subnet	255.255.255.0
opt	router	192.168.10.2
opt	wins	192.168.10.10
option	dns	129.219.13.81	# append to above DNS servers for a total of 3
option	domain	local
option	lease	864000		# 10 days of seconds

# Option 60 : This option is sent by DHCP clients to get some vendor specific
# information from the DHCP server. Based on the value received in this option, 
# the DHCP server selects the appropriate DHCP class to assign an address to the
# client and the appropriate configuration parameters. If this option is 
# configured then the DHCP server must respond to all the requests received 
# from the DHCP clients with option 60 with Option 43. So if option 60 is 
# configured then, configuration for option 43(vendorinfo) must be specified. 
# Option 60 value is a vendor defined string.Refer RFC2132 for further details.
 
# Examples 
# opt vendorid "MSFT 5.0"
# opt vendorid "udhcp0.9.7"
# opt vendorid "MSFT 98"

# Option 43 : This option is sent by the DHCP server to provide DHCP clients
# with the vendor specific information. If the DHCP server receives option 60 
# from a DHCP client, it must respond with this option. This configuration must
# be specified if configuration for option 60 is specified in the configuration 
# file. This option value is a Vendor encapsulated String to be processed by 
# DHCP clients. Refer RFC2132 for further details. 

# Examples
# opt vendorinfo MSFT
# opt vendorinfo UDHCP

# Option 77 : This option is sent by DHCP clients to optionally identify the 
# type or category of user or applications it represents. Based on the value 
# received in this option, the DHCP server selects the appropriate DHCP class to 
# assign an address to the client and the appropriate configuration parameters.
# Either option 60 or option 77 can be configured for a particular DHCP class.
# Refer RFC 3004 for further details.

# Examples
# opt userclass "Users"
# opt userclass "Power Users"
# opt userclass "Administrators"
